# Movie Search â€“ An ElasticSearch-powered movie search engine
Project work for course "Advanced Databases" during my 2nd Level Specializing Master's Programme at Polytechnic University of Turin.

## Abstract
"This report illustrates a solution proposal for the creation of an ElasticSearch-powered search engine aimed at analyzing data from the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes online movie databases. Multiple queries performed via the Python ElasticSearch library are solved and motivated. In addition, a Flask-based web application capable of performing full-text search is presented and discussed, together with an additional custom query of interest which can be useful in a real use case."
